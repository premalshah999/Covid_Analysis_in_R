> **When should governments act to prevent healthcare system collapse?**  
> A data-driven analysis of COVID-19 policy timing using machine learning.


##  Overview

This project analyzes **85,000+ observation-days** across **198 regions worldwide** to determine the optimal timing for government policy interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the [COVID-19 Data Hub](https://covid19datahub.io/), I built predictive models that can forecast ICU surges **14 days in advance** with exceptional accuracy.

### Key Findings

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
|  **Prediction Accuracy** | Random Forest achieves **AUC 0.94** for surge prediction |
|  **Warning Window** | Governments have **16 days** to act when ICU hits 10-15 per 100k |
|  **Best Predictor** | Current ICU utilization is the strongest predictor of future crises |
|  **Policy Effect** | High-stringency policies associated with **~3% lower** surge rates |

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version 4.0 or higher)
- [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/premalshah999/Covid_Analysis_in_R.git
   cd Covid_Analysis_in_R
   ```

2. **Install required packages**
   ```r
   # Run in R console
   required_packages <- c(
     "COVID19", "tidyverse", "lubridate", "zoo", "caret", 
     "randomForest", "pROC", "ggplot2", "gridExtra", "scales",
     "knitr", "kableExtra", "plotly", "viridis", "boot"
   )
   
   install.packages(required_packages)
   ```

3. **Run the analysis**
   ```r
   # Open in RStudio and knit, or run:
   rmarkdown::render("Policy_Timing_Optimization.Rmd")
   ```

##  Methodology

### Data Source
- **COVID-19 Data Hub**: Comprehensive database from University of Milan aggregating official pandemic statistics
- **Oxford Government Response Tracker**: Policy stringency index (0-100 scale)
- **Coverage**: 2020-2024, 198 regions with robust healthcare tracking

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Region Selection**: Filter to regions with ≥30% ICU data availability
2. **Negative Value Correction**: Handle reporting corrections
3. **Outlier Detection**: Flag values >10× regional median
4. **Missing Value Imputation**: Forward-fill for gaps ≤7 days
5. **Smoothing**: 7-day rolling averages to remove weekly artifacts

### Models Implemented

| Model | Purpose | Performance |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | Interpretable baseline | AUC: 0.69 |
| **Random Forest** | High-accuracy prediction | AUC: 0.94 |

### Validation Approach
- Region-based train/test split (prevents data leakage)
- Bootstrap confidence intervals
- Sensitivity analysis across thresholds

##  Visualizations

The analysis includes 10+ professional visualizations:

- **ICU Surge Patterns**: Geographic and temporal variation
- **Policy Stringency Evolution**: How governments responded over time
- **Model Comparison**: ROC curves and performance metrics
- **Feature Importance**: What drives predictions
- **Bootstrap Results**: Uncertainty quantification

##  Key Results

### ICU Surge Prediction
```
Random Forest Performance:
- AUC: 0.94 (Excellent)
- Sensitivity: 85%+
- Specificity: 90%+
- Lead Time: 14 days
```

### Policy Effectiveness
- **High stringency (≥60)**: 22.2% surge rate
- **Low stringency (<40)**: 25.6% surge rate
- **Difference**: Modest but consistent protective effect

### Decision Framework
| ICU Level (per 100k) | Risk Level | Recommended Action |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------|
| < 5 |  Safe | Monitor weekly |
| 5-10 |  Elevated | Increase vigilance |
| 10-15 |  High Risk | Prepare interventions |
| ≥ 15 |  Crisis | Immediate action required |

##  Limitations

- **Geographic Bias**: Predominantly Western European and North American data
- **Observational Study**: Associations, not causal claims
- **Confounding Factors**: Economic conditions, cultural compliance, healthcare capacity
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Virus variants evolved over study period

##  Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions are documented in [TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md](TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md).

**Quick fixes:**
- **"2 factor levels" error**: Change `set.seed(42)` to `set.seed(123)`
- **Memory issues**: Reduce `ntree = 500` to `ntree = 250`
- **Slow knitting**: Enable caching in chunk options
